After Nikkei's record run, investors want to know if Japan has changed for real
By Makiko Yamazaki and Rae Wee

A corporate governance makeover has helped fuel the revival of Japan's once-moribund stock market. 
Now investors want to see if the change is for real.
The Nikkei (.N225), opens new tab index shattered its all-time high last week, 
topping a level not seen since the December 1989 asset bubble - and continues to gain ground.
Overseas investors have been responsible for much of the buying.
That marks a big shift for Japan, which was long seen as indifferent to shareholders, 
particularly foreign ones with governance concerns around corporate cross-shareholdings, 
the lack of independent directors and resistance to takeover offers.
